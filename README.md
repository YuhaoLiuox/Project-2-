# Project-2-
In this project, we developed a GRU Neural Network with Maximum Likelihood Function as the loss function to forecast both the target values and model variance. This neural network can be used in predicting risk-adjusted target values by scaling the target values in inverse proportion to the forecast variance. For example, when we predict the future return of index such as S&P500, we could adjust the forecast values of return to make them more stable and accurate.
